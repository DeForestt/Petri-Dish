# Petri-Dish

This Project was inspired by an app that was on the android platform many years ago.  I thought that it was very interesting but it was removed and there is now no way to look at it.

It is based on a psudo natural selection. Each cell has a random set of behaviors that are scrambled when they mate.

The cells size and speed also varies geneticaly.

By pressing 's' during the runtime, the user can change world settings.

Next updates will add thirst and drinking to make the hiding spots more desierable.
